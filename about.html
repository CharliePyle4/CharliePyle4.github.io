            <h1>A Brief Introduction</h1>

            <!-- Education and Experience Section -->
            <h2>Education/Experience</h2>
            <p>I'm currently a student at Texas A&M studying Applied Math, Computer Science, and Statistics planning to graduate in May 2027. This semester I started working as a TA for Math170 and I also tutor independently for students in math and statistics classes. If you want tutoring or have any questions feel free to email me!</p>

            <!-- Career Interests Section -->
            <h2>Career Interests</h2>
            <p>I’ve got a deep passion for mathematics and its use in data analysis and prediction. I hope to one day work in data science, the finance industry, or as a software engineer where I can apply complex techniques to model challenging problems. I originally started coding to help with my investing, when I created a script to scrape stock picks and email the picks along with a portfolio overview to my email each morning. From there I got more interested in how coding and math played into investments, and have since done many projects in portfolio optimization, risk analysis, price prediction, and more.</p>
            <p>I use coding and statistics in other areas of my life as well, such as predicting NBA outcomes and automating everyday tasks, and I really love to see how it plays into the things I do daily. I'm currently looking for internships for the summer 2025 term, and am open to any roles to explore possible career paths. Feel free to email or call me regarding any openings or just to schedule a coffee chat!</p>

            <!-- Personal Life Section -->
            <h2>Personal Life</h2>
            <p>When I’m not in school, I like to destress from the day by working out or playing basketball. I'm a basketball fan, so I spend some of my time modeling player performance and trying to predict outcomes using quantitative approaches. I'm also a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity...</p>
